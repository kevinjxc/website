            <h3>
                <b>Kevin's ventures revolve around contributing his knowledge to support local communities and acting to resolve global issues.</b>
                Particularly, he is passionate about societal implications of education, as access to education has the capacity to polarize society.
                Beliefs, decisions, and lifetime outcomes all depend on the level of education one gains.
                Kevin is committed to helping South Seattle students from diverse backgrounds gain exposure to STEM education, especially as he reflect on similar barriers in his past.
